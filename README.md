Elastic-Bar
===========

Fixed navigation bar, with elastic response.

A navigation that responds to scroll position, making the navigation feel connected to the browser in a dynamic way.
Works better with trackpads.

ideas/notes/todo:
> Transparency blur could enhance the effect
< Break off and break on points. Shrink nav to 0 when scroll down x, expand when scroll up y.
